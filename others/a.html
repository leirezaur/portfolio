					<p><a href="https://www.collinsaerospace.com" target="_blank">Collins Aerospace</a> is one of the world’s largest suppliers of aerospace and aeronautics products, based in the USA. Even though it’s mainly focused on manufacturing and structures, Collins Aerospace's ARINCDirect is the most complete provider of business aviation solutions in the market today.</p>
                    <img src="../images/togethere/togethere-brand.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Togethere">
                    <h3>the goal &#127919;</h3>
					<p>Flight departments worldwide (flight crew, dispatchers and operation managers) face some digital challenges nowadays. The software they use is very technical and broad, confusing to use and poorly connected to third parties. Collins’ purpose is to design and offer the best <b>flight scheduling tool</b> in the market to be the industry leaders worldwide and attract more customers and users in the following years.</p>
                    <p>The big challenge we were presented came with 3 main objectives to cover in the first MVP iteration:</p>
                        <li>Build multiple <b>persona-focused</b> products. Customers only want to pay for what they use and it’s also easier for them to have simple effective tools for each action.</li>
                        <li>Scalability. The product we create has to be ready for <b>growth</b> and future improvements and new features that will come.</li>
                        <li>Responsiveness. The Calendar Exchange tool will be built as a <b>PWA</b> for users to access anywhere. This is a huge step forward among competitors in the aviation market.</li>
                    </br>
                    <p>The scope of this project included a big discovery phase with research and user feedback of the current tools used, flow definition, wireframing, user testing, high-fidelity design and interactions delivery, development, Beta release and final public release live in <b>April 2022</b>. The brief was closed in March 2021 and had January 2022 as a deadline for the Beta version, which we successfully accomplished.</p>
                    <p>My <b>role</b> in this Scheduling Engine project has been and currently is that of the UX/UI design lead.</p>

                    <h3>crafting the solution &#128173;</h3>

                    <p>The first steps included weeks of research. An online <b>form</b> for travelers asking how they travel, who with, where they found information, etc. turned really useful as a starting point. More than 50 responses gave me <b>data</b> and <b>insights</b> to continue.</p>
                    <img src="../images/togethere/answers.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Form answers">
                    <p>I studied the online travel platforms’ <b>market</b>, social networks and similar ideas and competitors, such as Couchsurfing, Airbnb, Meetic, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar or travel blogs. This <b>video</b> from the mid-process explains the need I found in the market and to solve it became my goal (the logo it appears is not the final version):</p>
                    <div class="fluid-video-wrapper">
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aem2Z_RbLE0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>This done, I started shaping both the brand and its values and the website itself. As a social network, Togethere needed to have the usual tabs every <b>network</b> needs: profile, a home/feed/dashboard, a search tool...</p>
                    <img src="../images/togethere/web-map.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Web map">
                    <p>Users could look for either travelers or travels in the <b>search engine</b>, so results could vary on profiles or travel cards.</p>
                    <img src="../images/togethere/wireframing.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Wireframing">
                    <p>I wanted the platform to be extra reliable and safe for travelers, and adding an <b>'affinity'</b> feature solved this issue. This meant enabling profiles to fill a small questionnaire when signing up, to get to know their preferences better and later show them and pair them with the most suitable profiles to travel with, depending on their age, interests, languages… This is Togethere’s <b>differential value</b>, as it allows user to find the perfect travel mate for each journey.</p>
                    <img src="../images/togethere/profile.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Profile">
                    <p>With the help of the data, designing UI elements like the travel card is easier. Every organized travel has an <b>information sheet</b> showing the most important facts of the journey at a glance.</p>
                    <img src="../images/togethere/cards.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Cards evolution">
                    <p>The concept of Togethere and its name were born from the <b>values</b> of diversity and society. It not only means traveling with other people, but also sharing experiences and knowledge and spreading love and <b>respect without borders</b> or tags.</p>
                    <img src="../images/togethere/naming.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Naming process">
                    <p>The brand represents the world and its different realities and <b>pieces</b> (containers). It also represents a <b>meeting point</b> for connections. Colors come from the <b>environment</b> that connects us, from the sandy sunsets and clear skies we all share as equal human beings.</p>
                    <img src="../images/togethere/branding.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Branding">
                    <p>A bunch of <b>elements</b> such as illustrations, buttons and icons were created from scratch for the identity of Togethere. The applications of the brand to different devices and merch was also considered.</p>
                    <img src="../images/togethere/illustrations.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Togethere illustrations">

                    <h3>final result &#10024;</h3>

                    <p>The final metrics of this project will come live in some months, as it was just launched live, but so far the feedback got from the Beta users and stakeholders has been beyond positive as expected. This shows a clear good communication and expectation management we had through the whole process, and sets some actionable next steps to follow in the next iterations.</p>
                    <p>This personally is my main takeaway from this project, being able to align so many stakeholders’ needs and cover complex requirements to build a functional top-notch tool. It’s been a whole experience to deal with so many different teams involved but all the constant and flowing communication has definitely paid off on the final result.</p>
                    <img src="../images/togethere/style.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Style">
                    <p>We are currently working on the new enhancements and features of the tool to keep delivering solutions to the users’ feedback in the following iterations.</p>
