					<p>Togethere is a social platform to join travelers from all over the world. This social network allows registered profiles to find people to travel with, as well as organized travels or packages. Togethere also allows to share the travel experiences to help other users to plan their travel better. This platform's aim is to create an active worldwide network for travelers, where people can help each other, and it's be based on sharing and diversity.</p>

                    <h3>the goal &#127919;</h3>

					<p>As an End-of-Degree project I decided to create a <b>gathering point</b> for travelers - combining both design and travels, my passions. The idea was to grow this concept by developing a brand and the platform itself.​​​ Starting from October 2015, I had 6 months to craft a solution <b>all by myself</b>.</p>
                    <p>The main goal of the project was to shape the <b>platform</b>: was it going to be an event, a physical space, an app? Analyzing who my <b>target</b> was, where they were and what needs they had was crucial for a starting point.</p>
                    <p>My <b>role</b> in Togethere was that of brand designer, naming designer, UX/UI, illustration artist and video editor.</p>

                    <h3>crafting the solution &#128173;</h3>

                    <p>The first steps included weeks of research. An online <b>form</b> for travelers asking how they travel, who with, where they found information, etc. turned really useful as a starting point. More than 50 responses gave me <b>data</b> and <b>insights</b> to continue.</p>
                    <img src="images/togethere/answers.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Form answers">
                    <p>I studied the online travel platforms’ <b>market</b>, social networks and similar ideas and competitors, such as Couchsurfing, Airbnb, Meetic, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar or travel blogs. This <b>video</b> from the mid-process explains the need I found in the market and to solve it became my goal (the logo it appears is not the final version):</p>
                    <div class="fluid-video-wrapper">
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aem2Z_RbLE0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>This done, I started shaping both the brand and its values and the website itself. As a social network, Togethere needed to have the usual tabs every <b>network</b> needs: profile, a home/feed/dashboard, a search tool...</p>
                    <img src="images/togethere/web-map.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Web map">
                    <p>Users could look for either travelers or travels in the <b>search engine</b>, so results could vary on profiles or travel cards.</p>
                    <img src="images/togethere/wireframing.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Wireframing">
                    <p>I wanted the platform to be extra reliable and safe for travelers, and adding an <b>'affinity'</b> feature solved this issue. This meant enabling profiles to fill a small questionnaire when signing up, to get to know their preferences better and later show them and pair them with the most suitable profiles to travel with, depending on their age, interests, languages… This is Togethere’s <b>differential value</b>, as it allows user to find the perfect travel mate for each journey.</p>
                    <img src="images/togethere/profile.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Profile">
                    <p>With the help of the data, designing UI elements like the travel card is easier. Every organized travel has an <b>information sheet</b> showing the most important facts of the journey at a glance.</p>
                    <img src="images/togethere/cards.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Cards evolution">

                    <h3>branding &#127912;</h3>

                    <p>The concept of Togethere and its name were born from the <b>values</b> of diversity and society. It not only means traveling with other people, but also sharing experiences and knowledge and spreading love and <b>respect without borders</b> or tags.</p>
                    <img src="images/togethere/naming.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Naming process">
                    <p>The brand represents the world and its different realities and <b>pieces</b> (containers). It also represents a <b>meeting point</b> for connections. Colors come from the <b>environment</b> that connects us, from the sandy sunsets and clear skies we all share as equal human beings.</p>
                    <img src="images/togethere/branding.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Branding">
                    <p>A bunch of <b>elements</b> such as illustrations, buttons and icons were created from scratch for the identity of Togethere. The applications of the brand to different devices and merch was also considered.</p>
                    <img src="images/togethere/illustrations.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Togethere illustrations">

                    <h3>final web result &#10024;</h3>

                    <p>Et voilà! A long process of UI design turned the wireframes into more deliverable-looking screens with <b>attractive components</b> and a user-centered experience.</p>
                    <img src="images/togethere/before-after.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Wireframe process">
                    <p>The website looks clear and <b>emphasizes</b> the custom content and security of profiles among other information.</p>
                    <img src="images/togethere/style.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Style">
                    <p>I felt specially proud of these categories’ icons that represented the different <b>travel moods</b> that could be posted: party, nature, relax, beach… They appear in the travel cards in order to visually sum that main mood up.</p>
                    <img src="images/togethere/top.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Togethere">
                    <img src="images/togethere/web.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Search results">
                    <p>The whole website and its different sections look very familiar to users, as Togethere reuses common <b>UI resources</b>, menus and structures from very similar platforms. This is also helpful not to break the mental models the target already has, and it makes the <b>learning curve</b> of the tool faster for new users.</p>
